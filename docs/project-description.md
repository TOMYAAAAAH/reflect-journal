# Reflect Journal


## Concept
This project is based on a real book called 5 years of reflecting. 
A journal with 366 pages, one a day. 
Each day you answer a simple question.
The next year you answer again the same question as last year, giving you time to reflect. 

## Application

I want the authenticated user to appear on a page with the date, the question of the day and an input to write their answer. 
Then they will see the previous answers for this question. 
They can also see the previous days answers.
